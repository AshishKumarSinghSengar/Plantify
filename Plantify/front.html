               <p style="font-size: 15px;">I feel there isn’t enough discussion about indoor air quality in the topic of Health and Wellness. Unlike food, water and exercise, literature about air quality seem to stay out in space, despite being one of the essential things we need as living beings here on Earth.
                According to the Environmental Protection Agency, American Lung Association, and research institutions such as The Berkeley Lab, indoor air pollution is a serious health hazard, which can cause dizziness, fatigue, headaches, and if exposed long-term, can lead to more serious respiratory diseases, heart diseases, and cancer. Unfortunately, these organizations claim indoor spaces, often in urban areas, are found to be more polluted than outside. Furthermore, studies from the US and Europe show that persons in industrialized nations spend more than 90 percent of their time indoors.
                The major perpetrator of air pollutants come from what’s called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs are carbon-containing organic chemicals that leak off of building materials, furnishings, consumer products, tobacco smoking, paint, people, animals, cleaning supplies, and indoor chemical reactions. Specific indoor VOCs are more toxic than others and cause havoc to our health.

               <p>This would be a website and app-based product with main idea of purifying the indoor air and removing the toxic pollutants in our home, office and hospitals with the help of Plants to lead a healthy life.
                Apart from electric air purifiers, there is a eco-friendly and natural way by which we can go. There are different kinds of plants, 6-8 plants which NASA has recommended and are proven to remove such toxic gases from our homes. Also, these plants are easily available in the nursery.

                        <p >English Ivy is extremely popular in outdoor landscaping. English ivies are one of the top 10 air-purifying plants,
                             according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). English ivies can remove toxins like:<br>
                            •	benzene<br>
                            •	formaldehyde<br>
                            •	xylene<br>
                            •	toulene<br>
                            These toxins can cause sick building syndrome. Sick building syndrome is when people feel ill when
                            spending time in a particular building or room.<br>
                            One study also found that English ivies could reduce particles of fecal matter and mold. Researchers found that the amount of fecal matter dropped by more than 94 percent in 12 hours. Mold went down by 78.5 percent.
